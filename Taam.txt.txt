TAAM is a Open Source Project Dedicated to the development of Web3 and related AI technologies which are the main concern of humanity today.

This includes but is not limited to in the domains of :-

Cybersecurity
Self Driving Technology
Alternatives to Blockchain
Control Systems for drones, robots and other humanoid systems.
Artificial General Intelligence
Battery Management
Renewable Energy Management
Bitcoin Tracing through Transactions
Face Detection for AR/VR
Development of SLM's for use in devices.
Development of Drivers for IoT devices
TAAM works on the premise that Open Source Code is the only way to make code robust, auditable and beneficial to humanity. Companies working on closed source code often make mistakes, have to recall products, or worse in the case of self driving technology leading to fatal errors for consumers.

Therefore, Open Source is the only way to make code auditable.

TAAM is available to buy on the Stellar Network. Stellar has been chosen specifically for the work they do to make it cash exchangeable, and work with the UNHCR and other organizations.
