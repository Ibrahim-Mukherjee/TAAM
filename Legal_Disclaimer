TAAM is a Open Source Project.

Which means that TAAM Source Code is openly available for anyone to use. 

The asset base of the TAAM coins is the Source Code. 

Developers are paid in TAAM coins for writing code for the project, investors can buy the Tokens from the Stellar Blockchain.

The TAAM project is held currently under Mukherjee Holdings Ltd. (UK Company Number - 14087670) ; however it is envisioned it will be spun off to a seperate entity some time in the future and will hold the remaining TAAM coins and the codebase. 

The Legal Structure may be optimized further for tax accounting, however the TAAM investors will always have the value of the coins linked to and ONLY TO the TAAM CodeBase and it's utility. 

TAAM is committed to working with the Stellar Foundation.
