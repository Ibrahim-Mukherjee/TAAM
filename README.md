Current Bounties Outstanding :- 

Self Driving: Low-Contrast Object Detection Bounty
Challenge: Develop an algorithm that can reliably detect objects in low-contrast situations, such as a white truck in front of white clouds, to improve the safety of self-driving cars.
Bounty: TAAM 1,000,000 for a solution that exceeds 95% accuracy in diverse weather and lighting conditions, as verified by a standardized test set.

Robotics: Real-Time Control System Bounty
Challenge: Create a real-time control system for robots that can perform a set of predefined tasks with high efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
Bounty: TAAM 1,00,000 for a system that demonstrates real-time adaptability and task execution with a latency of less than 10 milliseconds on a standard robotic platform.

Cybersecurity: Next-Generation Encryption Algorithm Bounty
Challenge: Invent a new encryption algorithm that provides a security level beyond current standards like SHA-256, with practical considerations for speed and resource usage.
Bounty: TAAM 1,000,000 for an algorithm that withstands all known cryptographic attacks and is peer-reviewed by recognized experts in the field of cryptography.
These bounties are designed to incentivize the development of solutions to specific, difficult problems in each of the three areas. The amounts are set to reflect the complexity and importance of the challenges, aiming to attract skilled individuals or teams to contribute their expertise to these cutting-edge fields.

Why did we float TAAM on the Stellar Blockchain? Stellar as a Foundation is working actively with UNHCR to provide cash in places without financial infrastructure like Ukraine.

Stellar as a ecosystem seems to the TAAM project's founders to be the most advanced, most realistic way of creating an alternative to the current Financial System and Infrastructure.

The TAAM foundation is committed to this mission and therefore hopes to work with the Stellar Foundation to actively accelerate Web3 development solving the most pressing needs of humanity today.
