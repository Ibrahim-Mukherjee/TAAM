Current Bounties Outstanding :- 
Programming Language :- Create a programming language similar to Vala. instead of C# like syntax, make the syntax as Python but it should compile to C similar to Vala. Create an IDE which can take code chunks like code grepper and put them inside "lego blocks" - the full code looks like a built lego house rather than lines of code. Work on any or all parts of this problem. The visual programming design, IDE, Python to C compiler or all of them together. contact for coin allocation at :- ibrahim-taam@proton.me

Self Driving :- Smart Contract to store maintenance and IOT data and provide firmware updates to the car. blockchain of self driving cars on the cloud for better detection of objects surrounding the car, protect cars from being opened maliciously using keyless hacking or being able to maliciously control the car remotely. PoC required. email at ibrahim-taam@proton.me

Self Driving: Low-Contrast Object Detection Bounty
Challenge: Develop an algorithm that can reliably detect objects in low-contrast situations, such as a white truck in front of white clouds, to improve the safety of self-driving cars.

Bounty: TAAM 1,000,000 for a solution that exceeds 95% accuracy in diverse weather and lighting conditions, as verified by a standardized test set. This includes making a Python Library in PIP. Smaller commits which only implement a part of it will also be given proportionate coins. 

Robotics: Real-Time Control System Bounty
Challenge: Create a real-time control system for robots that can perform a set of predefined tasks with high efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.

Bounty: TAAM 1,00,000 for a system that demonstrates real-time adaptability and task execution with a latency of less than 10 milliseconds on a standard robotic platform.

Cybersecurity: Next-Generation Encryption Algorithm Bounty
Challenge: Invent a new encryption algorithm that provides a security level beyond current standards like SHA-256, with practical considerations for speed and resource usage.

Bounty: TAAM 1,000,000 for an algorithm that withstands all known cryptographic attacks and is peer-reviewed by recognized experts in the field of cryptography.
These bounties are designed to incentivize the development of solutions to specific, difficult problems in each of the three areas. The amounts are set to reflect the complexity and importance of the challenges, aiming to attract skilled individuals or teams to contribute their expertise to these cutting-edge fields. This would include making a Python Library in PIP. Smaller commits which only implement a part of it will also given proportionate coins. 

LLMs: New Transformer Models. Create End-to-End New Transformer Models and alternative structures which prevent LLM's from Hallucinating. Provide Proof of Concept or End-To-End working Solution with a ArXiv Pre-Publication Paper or Simply CodeBase and working solution for audit. 

SHA256 Alternative : Provide a SHA256 Alternative to Encryption. Either a Proof of Concept or End to End Working Solution. 
!!!LATEST UPDATES FOR THE PROJECT IN THE WHITE-PAPER !!! (White Paper available on request, latest version will be updated here). 
TAAM is a Open Source Project creating the next gen of Web3 Infrastructure.

Why did we float TAAM on the Stellar Blockchain? Stellar as a Foundation is working actively with UNHCR to provide cash in places without financial infrastructure like Ukraine. Stellar acts as our 

Stellar as a ecosystem seems to the TAAM project's founders to be the most advanced, most realistic way of creating an alternative to the current Financial System and Infrastructure.

The TAAM foundation is committed to this mission and therefore hopes to work with the Stellar Foundation to actively accelerate Web3 development solving the most pressing needs of humanity today.
