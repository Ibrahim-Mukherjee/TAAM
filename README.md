Why did we float TAAM on the Stellar Blockchain? Stellar as a Foundation is working actively with UNHCR to provide cash in places without financial infrastructure like Ukraine.

Stellar as a ecosystem seems to the TAAM project's founders to be the most advanced, most realistic way of creating an alternative to the current Financial System and Infrastructure.

The TAAM foundation is committed to this mission and therefore hopes to work with the Stellar Foundation to actively accelerate Web3 development solving the most pressing needs of humanity today.
