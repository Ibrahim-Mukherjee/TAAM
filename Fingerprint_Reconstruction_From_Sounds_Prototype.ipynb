    "The concept of recreating fingerprints from typing sounds is based on a side-channel attack named \"PrintListener,\" which uses finger-swiping friction sounds captured by attackers online with a high possibility through popular apps like Discord, Skype, WeChat, FaceTime, etc. This attack leverages the sound characteristics of a user's finger swiping on a touchscreen to extract fingerprint pattern features[1][7][10][16]. The researchers have developed a series of algorithms for pre-processing the raw audio signals, which are then used to generate targeted synthetics for PatternMasterPrint[1]. \n",
